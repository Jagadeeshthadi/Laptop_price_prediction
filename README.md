# üíª Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on predicting the prices of laptops based on their specifications using machine learning. The model aims to assist consumers and retailers in estimating laptop prices by analyzing key features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, operating system, and graphics card.

The project follows the **CRISP-ML(Q)** methodology, ensuring a structured and quality-driven approach throughout the data science lifecycle.
